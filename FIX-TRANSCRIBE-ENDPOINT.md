# Critical Fix for Transcribe Endpoint

## Issue Identified

The transcription endpoint in `server.js` is not working because it is defined AFTER the catch-all 404 handler. 

The 404 handler catches all requests before they can reach any routes defined after it.

## How to Fix

1. Open `server.js` in an editor
2. Find the 404 handler at around line 1832:
   ```javascript
   // Custom 404 handler
   app.use((req, res) => {
     // ... HTML response code ...
   });
   ```

3. Cut this entire block (from the comment to the closing `});`)

4. Paste it at the very end of the file, after all other routes

5. Save the file

## Correct Route Order in Express.js

Express.js routes are matched in the order they are defined. The correct order is:

1. Global middleware (cors, etc.)
2. All specific route handlers (`app.get()`, `app.post()`, etc.)
3. 404 catch-all handler as the very last route

## Testing the Fix

After applying the fix, you should be able to access:
- `/transcribe?id=VIDEO_ID` 
- `/health`
- `/test-proxy` 

These endpoints will no longer result in 404 errors.

## Technical Explanation

In Express.js, `app.use()` without a path parameter catches ALL requests. When placed before specific routes, it prevents those routes from ever being matched. This is why the 404 handler must always be the last route defined in an Express application.
